We have talked about interfaces in C#.
Let's try out cars again.
Create a simple program to implement the following scenario

Car has the following properties - Make, Model and YearOfManufacture
You also have an ICar interface that Car must inherit from with the following method enforcements - Drive, Start, Stop

Upon inheritance, you should implement the interface methods and create your own implementation of it.
