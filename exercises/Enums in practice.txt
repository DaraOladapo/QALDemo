There are 12 months in the Gregorian calendar- January-December
Create an enumeration for that.
Then create a method that outputs the months and numeric value of it and the number of days in the month.
An example is shown below

1. January has 31 days

12. December has 31 days


After that is done.
Create another method that gets an input of a users's date of birth and returns the number of days in the month the user was born
An example is shown below
Input June 28, 1951
Output: Your month of birth - June has 30 days.
